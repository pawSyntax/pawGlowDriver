jumpered for the arduino to be powered from the receiver:
----------------------------------------------------------

when the receiver is off the arduino is not powered so glows will be off.

if for any reason there is no receiver pulse, but still receiver power, then the glow brightness is set to the value determined by the trim pot.

minimum receiver pulse length turns glows off.
